# Branching Strategy

Using a **branching strategy** is crucial for maintaining clean, scalable, and collaborative development workflows ‚Äî especially in production-grade projects on GitHub.

Here‚Äôs a breakdown of **best practices** for a production-ready GitHub project in terms of **branching models**, **naming**, and **workflow**.

---

## ‚úÖ GitHub Production Branching Best Practices

### üìå 1. **Use a Structured Branching Model**

The most common and reliable models are:

### ‚úÖ **A. GitHub Flow** (Simple, for Continuous Delivery)

* Good for smaller teams or rapid deployments.
* Main branch: `main`
* Features: short-lived branches off `main`
* Deployment happens directly from `main`.

**Branch Types**:

* `main`: production-ready
* `feature/xyz`: new features or bug fixes

‚úÖ **Best for**: Simple CI/CD, smaller teams, MVPs

---

### ‚úÖ **B. Git Flow** (Popular for larger teams and releases)

A more robust model that handles versioning, hotfixes, staging, and multiple developers.

**Branch Types**:

| Branch      | Purpose                                 |
| ----------- | --------------------------------------- |
| `main`      | Always stable, production-ready code    |
| `develop`   | Latest development integration          |
| `feature/*` | New features from `develop`             |
| `release/*` | Preparation for production release      |
| `hotfix/*`  | Quick fixes on `main`                   |
| `bugfix/*`  | Fixes on `develop` (not production yet) |

**Workflow**:

1. Branch off `develop` to create `feature/login-auth`
2. Merge to `develop` when done
3. Create `release/1.0.0` from `develop`
4. Merge `release/1.0.0` into both `main` and `develop`
5. Tag version on `main`
6. For urgent fixes, use `hotfix/critical-bug` from `main`

‚úÖ **Best for**: Enterprise projects, staged QA, versioning

## üìÇ 2. **Branch Naming Conventions**

Be consistent and descriptive. Use `/` to separate types, and `-` or camelCase for readability.

| Type    | Naming Example                  | Notes                       |
| ------- | ------------------------------- | --------------------------- |
| Feature | `feature/user-authentication`   | New features                |
| Bugfix  | `bugfix/login-validation-error` | Fixes in dev branch         |
| Hotfix  | `hotfix/payment-crash-fix`      | Fixes in production         |
| Release | `release/1.2.0`                 | Pre-release staging         |
| Chore   | `chore/cleanup-unused-code`     | DevOps or maintenance tasks |
| Docs    | `docs/update-readme`            | Documentation changes       |
| Test    | `test/api-endpoint-tests`       | Adding or modifying tests   |

---

### üîÄ 3. **Use Pull Requests (PRs) for All Changes**

* **No direct push to `main` or `develop`**
* Always create a PR to merge changes
* Enforce **PR reviews** for code quality
* Use **status checks** from CI (like GitHub Actions, Jenkins)

---

### üõ°Ô∏è 4. **Protect Your Main Branches**

In GitHub repo settings:

* Protect `main` and `develop`
* Require PR reviews
* Require passing CI checks
* Disable force-push and branch deletion

---

### üöÄ 5. **Deployment Branches (Optional)**

Some teams use:

* `staging` ‚Üí QA testing environment
* `production` ‚Üí live deployments

CI/CD pipelines deploy automatically based on these.

---

## ‚úÖ Recommended Branch Flow Summary

```plaintext
main       ‚Üí always deployable
develop    ‚Üí integrated dev features
feature/*  ‚Üí one feature per branch
release/*  ‚Üí stable release prep
hotfix/*   ‚Üí urgent prod fixes
```

---

## üí° Bonus Tips

* Always pull before creating a new branch
* Delete feature branches after merge (keep repo clean)
* Use semantic versioning (`v1.2.0`) in tags
* Automate with GitHub Actions or similar CI tools
